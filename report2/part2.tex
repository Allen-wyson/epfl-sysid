\section{Parametric Identification of an Active Suspension System}
In this section we identify a model between the current reference for the DC motor and the acceleration of the sprung mass of the active suspension system in Figure~\ref{fig:active_suspension}. 
Therefore, we use the time-domain data CE2.mat. This file contains the input $u$ and the output signal $y$ of the system with a set of $N = 2044$ data and a sampling time of $T_e = 0.03$. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5.5cm]{figures/active_suspension.png}
	\caption{An active suspension system}\label{fig:active_suspension}
\end{figure}
Before we start with the identification procedure, we remove the mean value of the input and output with the MATLAB \texttt{detrend} command and generate a data object with the MATLAB \texttt{iddata}.

\subsection{Order Estimation}
It is one of the goals of system identification to find the simplest model, which meets the desired criteria. Therefore, the model order estimation plays an important role in the procedure. In this section, we focus on finding the order for the Active Suspension System. 

\paragraph{Loss function criterion:} In the first approach, we use the ARX structure. As the loss function $ J(\hat{\theta}) /N $ for this structure is monotonically non-increasing with respect to the number of the parameter estimates (dimension of $\theta$), the model order can be estimated by analyzing the shape of the loss function. We set the delay to $n_k = 0$, the order of the nominator of the plant model $n_b$ equal to the order of the denominator $n_a$ and choose a maximum order of $n=10$. In doing so, we obtain $10$ different ARX models. The corresponding loss function is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:loss_fcn}. 
As the slope of the loss function is close to zero for $n \geq 6 $ we choose a model order equal to $n = 6.$

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/Loss_fcn.pdf}
	\caption{Residual losses for different ARX models with varying model order}\label{fig:loss_fcn}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Zero/Pole cancellation criterion:} Afterwards we want to validate the chosen order by using the zero/pole cancellation method applied to the ARMAX structure for different models. 
We set the order of the plant model $n_a$ and $n_b$ and the order of the noise model $n_c$ to the same value, that means $n_a = n_b = n_c = n $ and the delay equal to one, $n_k = 1$. 
As the estimated order is $6$ according to the loss function method, we choose $ n_{min} \leq n \leq n_{max}$ with $ n_{min} = 5$ and $n_{max}=8$. With the MATLAB command \texttt{iopzplot} we plot the zero/pole map of this $4$ different models, which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:zero_pole}. 
As we use noisy data for our identification, an exact zero pole cancellation is impossible (that means an exact overlap between a zero 'o' and a cross 'x' in the map respectively). To solve this issue, a confidence interval with a size of two times their standard deviation $\pm 2 \sigma$ for each pole and zero is plotted. At that point, one zero/pole cancellation indicates, that the order of the model is overestimated by one.

	\end{subfigure}\hfill
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}

		\subcaption{Zero/pole map for $n_a = n_b = n_c = 6 $}\label{fig:zp6}
	\end{subfigure}

		\subcaption{Zero/pole map for $n_a = n_b = n_c = 7 $}\label{fig:zp7}
	\end{subfigure}\hfill
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Zero/pole map for different ARMAX models}
	\label{fig:zero_pole}
\end{figure}

The zero/pole cancellation method validates our chosen order $n=6$. For an order of $n=7$ the confidence intervals are significantly larger than for lower orders. That is why we cannot determine the exact value of the poles. \\

\paragraph{Delay estimation:} As a next step, the delay $n_k$ is estimated. This is done by inspecting the impulse response of the system. As the impulse response is equal to the parameters $b_k$ of a FIR model, we use a high order FIR model to plot it. All we have to consider is that the number of parameters $m$ of this model is bigger then the settling time of the impulse response $g(t)$. As $g(t)$ is approximately zero after $ 1 s$ we set the model order to $m = 40$ due to the sampling time $T_e = 0.03 s$.
The time delay $d$ of the system can then be obtained as the number of the first values of the impulse response, that is the first parameters of the FIR model, that are equal to zero. 
However, using noisy data none of the values will be equal to zero. In this case a value can be considered as zero, if $ 0 \in \left[b_k -2 \sigma_k, b_k + 2\sigma_k \right] $ with $\sigma_k$ as the standard deviation of the k-th component. 

In MATLAB, we create the FIR model with the command \texttt{oe}. The code can be seen in Listing~\ref{lst:delay} (page~\pageref{lst:delay}).
Figure~\ref{fig:fir40} shows the impulse response and Figure~\ref{fig:fir40_dev} the parameters with their corresponding confidence interval. As the second value of the impulse response is approximately zero, we estimate the delay as $d=1$ and obtain $n_k = d + 1 = 2$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fir40.pdf}

		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fir40_dev.pdf}
		\subcaption{Impulse response (zoomed) + confidence interval}\label{fig:fir40_dev}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Impulse response of the system identified using a FIR model and the OE structure. It can be observed, that the second value is nearly equal to $0$. This implies a delay of $1$.}
	\label{fig:delay}
\end{figure}
As the last step, the number of the parameters in the numerator $n_b$ is estimated. This is done by comparing the loss function of different ARX models with a value of $n_b$ as follows: $1 \leq n_b \leq n  - n_k + 1 = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5$. This is done with the MATLAB variable \texttt{M.EstimationInfo.LossFcn}. The results can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:denom}.
As there is only a small reduction of the loss function between $n_b = 5$ and $n_b = 4$ compared to the other steps, we decide to choose $n_b = 4$. \\
Summarized, our estimated parameter values are $n_k = 2$, $n_a = 6$ and  $n_b = 4$.

	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|c}
	\hline
	\hline
	\textbf{Number of parameters $n_b$} & \textbf{Loss function of ARX model}\\
	\hline

		$4$ & $0.0161$ \\ \hline
		$3$ & $0.0204$ \\ \hline
		$2$ & $0.0529$ \\ \hline
		$1$ & $0.0711$ \\ \hline
	\hline
	\end{tabular}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/selstruc.png}
	\caption{Loss functions calculated with \texttt{arxstruc}}\label{fig:selstruc}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Comparison to model orders MATLAB proposes:} Finally, we compare our results with those proposed by MATLAB with the commands \texttt{struc}, \texttt{arxstruc} and \texttt{selstruc}. 
With \texttt{struc} we generate $1000$ model-order combinations for the ARX model estimation ($n_a = n_b = n_k = 10)$. Afterwards the loss functions for all the ARX models are calculated with \texttt{arxstruc}. \texttt{selstruc} then allows us to select a model order by showing the values of the different loss functions graphically (Figure~\ref{fig:selstruc}). 
The order proposed by MATLAB via \texttt{struc}, \texttt{arxstruc} and \texttt{selstruc} is significantly larger ($n > 10$). 
This is due to the fact, that MATLAB tries to fit the noise as well and not just only the real data. 
It can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:selstruc} that the output variance is almost constant for more than $10$ parameters.
As we want a good trade-off between computational cost and the variance, $10$ parameters seems to be a reasonable choice.
This coincides with the choice we made before, since $n_a + n_b = 6 + 4 = 10$. 

\subsection{Parametric Identification}
In this section, we want to create different parametric models using the estimated values for the parameters $n_a$, $n_b$ and $n_k$ from the previous section. 
Therefore, we use various MATLAB commands. 
We create an ARX model, an Instrumental variables method model, an ARMAX model, an Output error structure model, a Box-Jenkins model and a State space models.
Doing that, we divide the data into different parts. 
The first one we use for the model identification and the second one for the model validation. 
Our code for data partitioning and identification with different methods can be viewed in Listing~\ref{lst:parametric} on page~\pageref{lst:parametric}.

\subsection{Model Validation}

\paragraph{Time-Domain Validation:}
As a final step, we want to validate the identified parametric models. Therefore, the data set of $N = 2044$ is again partitioned in two parts. 
The second half of the data, that has not been used for the identification, is used to validate the models. 
First, we compare the output of the models with the measured output of the second half of the data.  
Thereby, the same input is applied to the model and the system. 
The results can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:comparison}
According to this, the best model is the State Space Model with a fit of $74.98 \% $.

	\caption{Comparison of the frequency response of the identified model and the frequency response of the validation data obtained using the spectral analysis method.}
	\label{fig:comparison_freq}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Whiteness and Cross-Correlation Test: }
Afterwards, we want to validate our models by the whiteness test of the residuals $\epsilon$ and the cross-correlation of the residuals and the past inputs $u$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross-correlation test: If the plant model is correctly identified, there is no information from the past inputs in the residuals and therefore, the residuals should be uncorrelated with those inputs. 
	For the cross-correlation test, an estimate of the cross-correlation between the residual and the input signal $\hat{R}_{\epsilon u}(h)$ is computed. The cross-correlation should be zero in order to validate the model. In practice, a statistical test with a $95\%$ confidence interval is used, where the values for the cross-correlation must lie within. This test can be used to validate the plant model for all structures. However, it gives no information about the validation of the noise model. 
	The results of the cross-correlation tests can be seen in the right part of Figures~\ref{fig:v_arx} to \ref{fig:v_n4sid}. 
	\item Whiteness test: For the models with a noise model (ARX, ARMAX and Box-Jenkins) we assume that the system noise is a white noise filtered by some transfer function. Therefore, if the parameters of the plant model and those of the noise model are correctly identified, the residual $\epsilon (k, \hat{\theta}) = y(k) - \hat{y}(k, \hat{\theta})$ will be white.
	The whiteness test checks the whiteness of the residual by computing the autocorrelation of $\epsilon$. This autocorrelation function will be zero for all $h \neq 0$, if $\epsilon$ is white. In practice, again a $95\%$ confidence interval is used, where the values for the cross-correlation must lie within.
	Therefore, this test is only reasonable for structures with a noise model.
	The results of the whiteness tests can be seen in the left part of Figures~\ref{fig:v_arx} to \ref{fig:v_n4sid}.

Based on the results of the statistical tests of the identified models, we discuss about their validation below.
\begin{itemize}
\item{ARX model}
\item{Instrumental variables}
\item{ARMAX model}
\item{Output error structure} For the output error structure the whiteness test (left part of Figure~\ref{fig:v_oe}) can be ignored, as this structure does not include a noise model. However, the condition of the cross-correlation test is not met as there are several values of the cross-correlation function lying outside the confidence interval (right part in Figure~\ref{fig:v_oe}). This is why the output error structure is no validated model. 
\item{Box Jenkins} For the Box Jenkins model the residual is white as all values of the autocorrelation function $R_{\epsilon \epsilon}$ are within the confidence interval (left part of Figure~\ref{fig:v_bj}). Nevertheless, this model is not validated in the cross-correlation test, as several values of the cross-correlation function are bigger than the confidence interval (right part in Figure~\ref{fig:v_bj}).
\item{State space model}
Like for the output error structure, the whiteness test (left part of Figure~\ref{fig:v_n4sid}) does not make sense for the state space model, as this structure does not include a noise model. However, the cross-correlation test is not validated as there are several values of the cross-correlation function lying outside the confidence interval (right part in Figure~\ref{fig:v_n4sid}). This is why the state space model is not a validated model.
\end{itemize}
