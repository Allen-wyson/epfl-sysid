:stem: latexmath

=== 1. Compare impulse, step, sum of sinusoids, discrete random processes and PRBS signals in terms of their spectra and their degrees of excitation.

* *Impulse*: Constant 1 spectrum and excitation in all frequencies,
infinite degree of excitation. The signal has very low energy as it
inputs zero energy everywhere except at latexmath:[k=0].
* *Step*: In theory the degree of excitation is also infinite. However, the step signal puts more energy in low frequency and the energy per frequency quickly decays over the frequency axis. In consequence if a system is excited by a step signal, very low frequencies and the DC part are strongly excited while high frequency are approximately not excited at all.
* *Sum of Sinusoids*: The degree of excitation is n, where n is the number of sinusoids summed. The spectrum is discrete and hand specific peaks at the frequencies of the summed sinusoids.
* *Discrete Random Processes*: Discrete random processes have also infinite degree of excitation as the spectrum is continuous. The spectrum depends on the covariance of the noise.
* *PRBS*: The signal is periodic and the spectrum is therefore discrete and the degree of excitation is finite. The spectrum of a pure (non-divided) PRBS signal is flat and it can be shaped using frequency dividers.

=== 2. How can we find the impulse response of a system using the correlation approach?

For white noise latexmath:[g(h) = \frac{\hat{R}_{yu}(h)}{\hat{R}_{uu}(0)}], else if the input signal is not white numerical deconvolution using the following relation:
[latexmath]
+++++++++++
R_{yu}(h) = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{K-1} g(j) R_{uu}(h - j)
+++++++++++

In the above equations latexmath:[\hat{R}_{uu}] denote the estimated autocorrelation of the input signal and latexmath:[\hat{R}_{yu}] denotes the estimated cross-correlation between the input and output signal.

=== 3. How is a PRBS generated? What is the period of a PRBS? How can its richness at low frequencies be improved?

=== 4. Explain the principle of bias-variance trade-off in estimation problems.

=== 5. Explain the principle of Fourier analysis. Name three major errors in Fourier analysis. Explain how the truncation error can be reduced.

=== 6. Explain how the frequency response can be identified using the spectral analysis method. How can the estimates be improved by averaging? How can the estimates be improved with windowing? Discuss the choice of the window's width.

=== 7. Why are we interested in closed-loop identification? What is the major problem? How can a good model be obtained by spectral analysis?

=== 8. Define the ARX structure with a block diagram. Discuss its properties (fit criterion, biasedness, optimization, bias distribution).
